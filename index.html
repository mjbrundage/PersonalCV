                    <li>We secured the different municipal departments and protected against unautorized data access.</li>

            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2023 I moved an entire <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sql/#:~:text=Structured%20query%20language%20(SQL)%20is,relationships%20between%20the%20data%20values.">SQL</a> database with more than 15,000 customer records from a <a href="https://www.liquidweb.com/">Liquid Web</a> <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> server to a <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a> database.</li>
