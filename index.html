    <h2>Experience</h2>
       <ul>
            <p>
                <li>In 2024 I developed a new <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> program for engagement that sends custom Happy Birthday emails to friends, family, clients, or employees.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The software takes data from a .csv file allowing for import from legacy softwares and Excel.</li>
                    <li>It is capable of creating more than one record and sending multiple emails.</li>
                    <li>The program runs in the cloud with 99.9% uptime and runs daily at 7am.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2024 I finished development and put in production, my own <a href="https://betterstack.com/community/guides/monitoring/what-is-uptime-monitoring/">Uptime Monitoring & Alert</a> software.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I wrote all the code in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>.</li>
                    <li>My enire codebase is secured in a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> repository.</li>
                    <li>I forked the repo and have a live production branch as well as a beta branch, allowing me to beta test additional features.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2024 I physically built, and started self hosting, a server for <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/">Foundry VTT</a>, allowing for play of <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons & Dragons</a> tabletop roleplaying game online.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I installed <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/">Foundry VTT</a> on the server, and forwarded ports to allow for access from anywhere.</li>
                    <li>The server was placed on an isolated subnet with no communication to the other subnets.</li>
                    <li>I then rented the server out for groups to use to play their games.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2023 I started self hosting ticketing software for my customers.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I chose <a href="https://www.uvdesk.com/en/">UVDesk</a> as my software.</li>
                    <li>I created a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> container from the command line and placed <a href="https://www.uvdesk.com/en/">UVDesk</a> in it.</li>
                    <li>I hosted the deployment on <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and created DNS records to use my existing Domain.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2023 I built a complete <a href="https://www.ui.com/">UniFi</a> deployment including, Network, Protect, Access, and Talk.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Placed entire system in a <a href="https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/cloud-gateways-addons/products/toolless-mini-rack"> 6U Rack</a>, including complete <a href="https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/cloud-gateways-addons/products/usp-rps">Power Backup</a>.</li>
                    <li>Setup was clean with no loose or extra cables.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2023 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-thompson-000976b9/">Perry Thompson</a> and I performed an in place security overhaul of a municipal network, rebuilding, subnetting, and setting up multiple vLANs.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We secured the different municipal departments and protected against unautorized data access.</li>
                    <li>We also setup new wireless SSIDs and further isolated against breaches while keeping the entire public Wi-Fi, and the individual public devices isolated.</li>
                    <li>We did all of this with 99.9% uptime, only taking the network down long enough to reboot, and after hours at that.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2023 I used a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> to create a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device for a client.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The client lost a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us">Synology</a> NAS controller in the middle of a workday, and I was onsite within 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>After copying their data to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> controlled NAS, we sent the <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us">Synology</a> NAS for warranty replacement.</li>
                    <li>The client liked the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> controlled NAS so much that they continued to use it even after the other was returned.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2023 I moved an entire <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sql/#:~:text=Structured%20query%20language%20(SQL)%20is,relationships%20between%20the%20data%20values.">SQL</a> database with more than 15,000 customer records from a <a href="https://www.liquidweb.com/">Liquid Web</a> <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> server to a <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a> database.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I did this with no downtime in marketing campaigns and no loss of customer records.</li>
                    <li>I also adjusted DNS records to migrate to a new website, new email, and new file servers with no losses or downtime.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2022 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-thompson-000976b9/">Perry Thompson</a> and I replaced ethernet connections, and built a new network for a large apartment complex in East Lansing, MI.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We built the whole network using <a href="https://www.ui.com/">UniFi</a> technologies as per client request.</li>
                    <li>We built a new LAN, subnetted, and created vLAN's all within the <a href="https://www.ui.com/">UniFi</a> Cloud Console.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-thompson-000976b9/">Perry Thompson</a> and I mirrored their pre-exsisting SSID's and brought the new network up inline with the old, resulting in 99.9% uptime and the network being down no longer than a re-boot.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We ran all network cables and mounted both indoor and outdoor security cameras.</li>
                    <li>We terminated all connections, mounted switches, designed the network, and completed all work before grand opening with no downtime.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2020 I started working with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, and migrated sites to the platform.</li>
                <ul>

                    <li>I migrated both <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> websites and Static sites.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We also built a <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> store into the site.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>

                    <li>This website was built on an extremely tight turnaround of 14 days.</li>
                    <li>I also custom built their application forms and put them live on the site.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2020 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-mclaughlin-b6245173/">Eric McLaughlin</a> and I built a website for <a href="https://promarketallies.com/">Pro Market Allies</a> in Mt. Pleasant, MI.</li>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2018 I built a <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> (<a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>) server to use as a locally hosted web server.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the server was built and the OS was installed I performed the rest of the installs and updates/upgrades headlessly from the Command Line Interface.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This was the first time I had used multiple GPU's and it was extremely successful.</li>
                    <li>The GPU's and the CPU were overclocked by me slightly and the resulting performance was excellent for the technology at the time.</li>
                </ul>
