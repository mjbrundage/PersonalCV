    <h2>Experience</h2>
       <ul>
            <p>
                <li>In 2023 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-thompson-000976b9/">Perry Thompson</a> and I performed an in place security overhaul of a municipal network, rebuilding, subnetting, and setting up multiple vLANs.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We secured the different municipal departments and protected against unautorized data access.</li>
                    <li>We also setup new wireless SSIDs and further isolated against breaches while keeping the entire public wi-fi, and the individual public devices isolated.</li>
                    <li>We did all of this with 99.9% uptime, only taking the network down long enough to reboot, and after hours at that.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2023 I moved an entire <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sql/#:~:text=Structured%20query%20language%20(SQL)%20is,relationships%20between%20the%20data%20values.">SQL</a> database with more than 15,000 customer records from a <a href="https://www.liquidweb.com/">Liquid Web</a> <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> server to a <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a> database.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I did this with no downtime in marketing campaigns and no loss of customer records.</li>
                    <li>I also adjusted DNS records to migrate to a new website, new email, and new file servers with no losses or downtime.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2022 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-thompson-000976b9/">Perry Thompson</a> and I replaced ethernet connections, and built a new network for a large apartment complex in East Lansing, MI.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We built the whole network using <a href="https://www.ui.com/">UniFi</a> technologies as per client request.</li>
                    <li>We built a new LAN, subnetted, and created vLAN's all within the <a href="https://www.ui.com/">UniFi</a> Dream Machine Console.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-thompson-000976b9/">Perry Thompson</a> and I mirrored their pre-exsisting SSID's and brought the new network up inline with the old, resulting in 99.9% uptime and the network being down no longer than a re-boot.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We ran all network cables and mounted both indoor and outdoor security cameras.</li>
                    <li>We terminated all connections, mounted switches, designed the network, and completed all work before grand opening with no downtime.</li>

            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 2005 I built a high end "Gaming" machine for a family member using parts sourced from multiple different retailers managing to save 50% of the cost of the same PC design from an online retailer.</li>
                <ul>
